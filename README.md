Developed for the **DesignHer Competition 2025** â€“ a frontend-only web design â€“ this web application promotes inclusive education by offering access to IT field modules, mentorship, and community support in a friendly and empowering environment.

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Selected This Topic

I chose to create an online learning platform because I believe in the power of accessible education to uplift and inspire. **TechLily** is dedicated to empowering girls and women in tech by providing structured learning paths in fields such as web development, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and more.

All instructors on the platform are women, creating a relatable and encouraging learning experience.

My goal is to make tech education not only accessible but also inspiring â€” where women can confidently learn, grow, and lead in the tech industry.
